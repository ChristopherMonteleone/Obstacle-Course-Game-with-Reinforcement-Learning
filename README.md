<h1>Obstacle Course Game with Reinforcement Learning</h1>
    <p>This project showcases the application of reinforcement learning in a dynamic "Grid World" game environment. Developed using Pygame, it serves as a versatile platform for experimenting with Q-Learning techniques, enabling an AI agent to navigate through and master obstacle-laden courses. Inspired by a FreeCodeCamp tutorial on teaching an AI to play Snake, this project takes a leap further by introducing dynamically generated environments, allowing for a unique training ground with each reset.</p>
    <h2>Key Features:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning Application</strong>: Utilizes Q-Learning, a type of reinforcement learning, to train an AI agent, demonstrating the agent's ability to learn from interactions within the environment and incrementally improve performance to find optimal paths.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Environment Generation</strong>: Each reset creates a new environment, presenting the AI with continuous novel challenges and facilitating robust learning through varied experiences.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Improvement Over Time</strong>: The AI agent progressively learns and adapts to achieve better efficiency in navigating the courses, showcasing the power of reinforcement learning in evolving AI capabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Project Inspiration:</h2>
    <p>Motivated by a tutorial from FreeCodeCamp on developing a Snake game AI, this project expands on the concept by applying reinforcement learning in a different context. By creating a "Grid World" game from scratch and focusing on dynamic environment generation, it offers a deeper insight into both the implementation of reinforcement learning techniques and the nuances of Q-Learning.</p>
    <h2>Learning Outcome:</h2>
    <p>The development process provided a hands-on experience in applying Q-Learning techniques to a custom-built game, enhancing my understanding of reinforcement learning's practical applications. It also allowed me to explore Pygame for creating interactive, graphical game environments, further broadening my skill set in software development.</p>
    <h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pygame</strong>: For game development, providing a rich set of features to create interactive graphical applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)</strong>: The core algorithmic technique used to equip the AI agent with learning capabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Python</strong>: The primary programming language for developing the game logic and implementing the learning algorithm.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>About the Developer:</h2>
