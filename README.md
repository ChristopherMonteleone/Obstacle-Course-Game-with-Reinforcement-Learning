# Obstacle-Course-Game-with-Reinforcement-Learning

This project is a "Grid World" game created using Pygame to a platform for reinforcement learning experimentation. Q-Learning techniques are used to teach the AI agent to navigate and master the game effectively. 
The agent is able to learn and improve its performance over time, achieving optimal paths after many training iterations. This project is inspired by a FreeCodeCamp tutorial, where a Snake AI is taught to master the game.
In my project, the environments are created dynamically upon reset, allowing the user to watch the AI train in unique environments. The Q-Learning techniques are applied to this simple game I developed to better understand
both reinforcement learning techniques and Q-Learning.
